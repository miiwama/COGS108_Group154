    "Energy consumption in households is influenced by a variety of factors including but not limited to seasonal changes, weather patterns and regional behaviors. San Diego, in particular, is home to a surprising variety of microclimates, each offering a distinct weather experience despite their proximity to one another<sup><a href=\"#cite_ref1\">[1]</a></sup>. Unlike regions with clearly defined seasons, San Diego experiences subtle but varied weather shifts, such as dry heat in one area and humidity in another during summer, or cool winters without snow. These mild yet diverse conditions may lead to unique, localized trends in energy use.\n",
    "Despite the significance of these patterns, most research on energy consumption has focused on larger metropolitan areas or regions with more extreme weather conditions. For instance, Alaska, which experiences extreme cold weather, has two metropolitan areas. According to the US Energy Information Administration, Alaska had the highest per capita total primary energy consumption at the state level in 2022 with about 987 MMBtu (Million British Thermal Units) per person and the highest per capita transportation energy use<sup><a href=\"./#cite_ref2\">[2]</a></sup>. In contrast, temperate coastal cities like San Diego remain understudied, presenting an opportunity to examine how subtle weather fluctuations affect energy demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Past research, such as the study published in Frontiers in Energy Research (2022), has shown that household energy consumption can vary significantly based on appliance usage and individual behavior, emphasizing the need for accurate energy forecasting at the local level<sup><a href=\"./#cite_ref3\">[3]</a></sup>. To predict energy demand more accurately, researchers have used various models such as time series regression, which looks at the past energy demand to create patterns, and random forest models, which are able to handle complex data and inter correlations. Other methods also include the use of both ARIMA (a statistical model) and the LSTM neural network (a type of machine learning)<sup><a href=\"./#cite_ref4\">[4]</a></sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these localized patterns in energy consumption, especially in regions like San Diego, can empower San Diego residents to make more cost-effective and sustainable energy decisions. Energy use typically peaks at certain times, when utilities must rely on the most expensive and resource-intensive electricity sources to meet demand<sup><a href=\"./#cite_ref5\">[5]</a></sup>. By predicting when energy demand will peak due to subtle weather changes, residents can shift their usage to off-peak hours, saving money and easing pressure on the electrical grid. On a larger scale, this helps lower reliance on high-emission energy sources, contributing to a more resilient, low-carbon infrastructure. As climate conditions become less predictable and energy needs continue to rise, exploring how microclimate-driven behaviors affect consumption becomes a relevant and essential study.\n",

    "This study will analyze variables such as zip codes, monthly average electricity consumption, average temperature, humidity, precipitation, date, month, and year. Data will be aggregated at the zip code level across San Diego County. The analysis will focus on the period from 2021 to the present, excluding data from 2020 due to the pandemic’s impact on energy consumption behaviors. Since people were largely confined to their homes in 2020, electricity usage patterns were atypical and could skew the results. Similarly, we will exclude pre-pandemic data, as energy consumption habits may have been significantly different prior to 2020. Beginning the analysis in 2021 allows us to establish a more stable and representative baseline that reflects post-pandemic adjustments. With that said, the following are the datasets we will be using for our analysis.\n",

The original data included four customer classes, but we retained only the residential class, as the others were not the focus of our interest.\n",

We will aggregate the weather data to a monthly level to align it with the SDGE dataset. The two datasets will then be merged using zip code, month, and year as keys.

    "There may be several potential biases and privacy concerns associated with the proposed energy consumption data. The data might contain personally identifiable information (PII), which would require careful handling to protect individual privacy. Additionally, there could be potential biases related to how the data was collected and who is represented within it. For instance, certain neighborhoods, particularly higher-income areas with smart meters, solar panels, or better internet access may be overrepresented, while lower-income communities without advanced infrastructure could be underrepresented. Demographic biases may also be embedded in the energy usage patterns due to historic housing segregation, affecting the equity of any resulting analysis. To address these concerns, steps will be taken to detect biases throughout the project lifecycle, including before, during, and after analysis, and especially when communicating findings. Specific strategies include focusing on transparency by clearly stating data sources, preprocessing methods, and known limitations, as well as working with aggregated or anonymized data whenever possible to minimize privacy risks and ensure more equitable outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to rigorously protect individual privacy in this study could lead to increased concerns about the misuse of residents' energy data and potentially eroding trust in both energy providers and research institutions. Even anonymized data, if mishandled or combined with other sources, could inadvertently lead to the re-identification of households or discriminatory practices. Furthermore, biases inherent in the data collection, potentially over-representing certain geographical areas or demographics within San Diego County, could result in prediction models that reinforce existing socioeconomic disparities. This could lead to inequitable resource allocation, the development of ineffective or even discriminatory energy policies, and the potential for social stigma against certain communities. Ultimately, we recognize that the value of our study on predicting average household energy consumption in San Diego County hinges not only on its accuracy but also on its ethical grounding. Therefore, we will proactively integrate considerations of these societal implications throughout our research process, from data acquisition and analysis to the dissemination of findings.\n"
